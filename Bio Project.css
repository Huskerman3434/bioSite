    <p>Chelsea grew up in Papillion, NE loving animals.  That love soon drove her to experience many different situations that led her down the path to become a veterinarian.  As Chelsea grew up she began wondering what she wanted to do in life.  She was a very caring person and loved working with people and thought that she might want to be a missionary.  She took trips with the church youth group to Canada and helped the homeless and events like this were shaping who she would become.  Later as she went through High School she applied to a new program at her school designated as a Zoo Academy.  In this program students were able to go to their normal High School for half the day and then spend the rest of the day at the Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo for the rest of her classwork.  Working with the zoo veterinarians and doing all kinds of cool projects involving the animals and how to care for them.</p>

    <p>Quote from Dr. Kennedy!</p>
    <p>"My whole life I've known that if I treated people the way that I wanted to be treated that my life would be rewarding to me.  When I decided to become a veterinarian I took that same philosophy and applied it to my practice with regards to caring for animals."</p>
